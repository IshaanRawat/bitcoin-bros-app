        The vastness of the cosmos is reflected in the universe of digital
        assets. Value lies in sharing and enriching our collective experiences,
        not hoarding. The future holds a world where a &ldquo;Meme Coin&rdquo;
        can rival a blue-chip stock, where a digital kitten carries more clout
        than a luxury car. It&apos;s weird, wacky, wonderful, and unstoppable.
